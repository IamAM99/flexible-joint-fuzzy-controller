# A Fuzzy Logic Controller for a Rotary Flexible Joint Robotic Arm

This research aims to design a fuzzy logic feedback controller (FLC) to control a desired tip angle position in a rotary flexible joint robotic arm. The FLC is also employed to dampen the vibration emanating from a rotary flexible joint robotic arm when reaching a desired tip angle position. The performance of the FLC was tested in simulation and experiment using MATLAB's Simulink. The results show that the fuzzy logic controller performed satisfactorily, controlling a desired tip angle position and reducing its oscillations.
